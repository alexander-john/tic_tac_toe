 * Rules of the game
 * -------------------
 * The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to get three X's or O's in a row.
 * This is a two player game. You play on a three by three board. The first
 * player is X and the second is O. X always goes first. Players take turns
 * and place their X or O on the board until one of the X's or O's has three
 * in a row. If all nine squares gets filled and there are no winners, the
 * game is a tie.
